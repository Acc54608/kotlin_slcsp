Hi, this script is a submission for the Second Lowest Cost Silver Plan homework.
I used a Linux Mint VM to make sure these instructions should work for building.
The instructions to be able to run the script from command line should be as follows:
Install Kotlin's standalone compiler itself here: https://kotlinlang.org/docs/command-line.html
Download and install Maven, I used the software manager in Mint but you can just download and
unzip it then add the bin to PATH
And install kscript from here https://github.com/holgerbrandl/kscript I used SDKMAN to install 
this and the kotlin compiler.
After those 3 things are installed and set up you can just open a terminal in the folder and run with the command "kscript slcsp.kts"
